1. Tools

   Following tools have been prepared for you:
     - verilator
     - gtkwave

   To use gtkwave, you need to ssh to your VM usign -Y (or -X) options
   to enable tunneling.


2. Building/Running your simulator code

   Following are the commands to build and run the code:

   > make       // build code
   > make run   // run code

   Run these commands in the subfolder containing the design, not the
   top-level HW1 folder.  The result of running the code will be a
   'trace.vcd' waveform file.  You can view it using 'gtkwave' (see
   instructions below).


3. Viewing the trace.vcd waveform

   If you have logged in to the server using the -Y or -X option, you
   can view waveforms using the following command:

   > gtkwave <path-to-the-vcd-file>


4. Submitting your code

   First, make sure that you have set your NETID in 'conf/user.mk'.

   Type the following command in your project directory. It will sign
   and submit your code to us:

  > make submit

   Run this command in the top-level HW1 folder, not the
   design-specific subfolders.
   

5. What to implement?

   1) There are four sub-projects in this homework: a decoder, a
   shifter, a packet verifier and a sequential multiplier.  Read the
   instructions given in each file for the details of what needs to be
   done in each sub-project.

   2) Make sure you test your designs as much as you can by providing
   test inputs and checking the output and/or generated waveforms.
   You should write your tests in "main.cpp".  See the two sample
   designs, "example-seq" and "example-comb", to learn how to apply
   inputs and advance the time when testing.
